Given a string s consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets '{' and '}', find out the minimum number of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression. A reversal means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.

Examples:

Input: s = "}{{}}{{{"

Output: 3

Explanation: One way to balance is:
"{{{}}{}}". There is no balanced sequence
that can be formed in lesser reversals.


Input: s = "{{}{{{}{{}}{{"

Output: -1

Explanation: There's no way we can balance
this sequence of braces.

Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5
