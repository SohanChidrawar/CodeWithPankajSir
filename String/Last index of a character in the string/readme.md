Given a string S  and a character X, the task is to find the last index (0 based indexing) of X in string S. If no index found then the answer will be -1.


Example 1:

Input: S = "Geeks", P = 'e'

Output: 2

Explanation: Last index of 'e' 
is 2.


Example 2:

Input: S = "okiyh", P = 'z'

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no character
as 'z'.

Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function LastIndex() which takes the string s and character p as inputs and returns the answer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
S and P contain only lower and upper case alphabets.
