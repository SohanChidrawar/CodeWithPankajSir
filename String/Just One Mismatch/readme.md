Given a string S and array of strings, find whether the array contains a string with one character different from the given string.

 
Example 1:

Input :

N = 4

arr[] = {"bana","apple","banaba","bonanzo"}

S = "banana"

Output :
True

Explanation:

banana and banaba has only one character 
different.

Example 2:

Input:

N = 4

arr[] = {"bana","apple","banaba","bonanzo"}

S = "apple"

Output :
False

Explanation: 

No string in arr differ by one 
character from S 
 

 Your Task: 
 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isStringExist() which takes the string array arr[], its size N and a string S as input parameters and returns "True" if a string exists in arr which has only one character different from S else return "False".

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Length of the string S)

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

 

Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤| arr[i] | ≤ 1000
1 ≤| S | ≤ 1000
