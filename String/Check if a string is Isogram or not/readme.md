Given a string s of lowercase alphabets, You have to check that  it is isogram or not.

An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Examples:

Input: s = "machine"

Output: true

Explanation: "machine" is an isogram as no letter has appeared twice. so we return true.


Input: s = "geeks"

Output: false

Explanation: "geeks" is not an isogram as 'e' appears twice. so we return false.

Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3
