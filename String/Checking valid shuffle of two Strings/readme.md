Given two strings str1 and str2, and a third-string shuffle, determine if shuffle is a valid shuffle of str1 and str2, where a valid shuffle contains all characters from str1 and str2 occurring the same number of times, regardless of order. Print "YES" if valid, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples: 

Input: str1 = BA, str2 = XY, shuffle = XYAB 

Output: YES

Input: str1 = BA, str2 = XY, shuffle = XUMB 

Output: NO

Input: str1 = ABC, str2 = ZYS, shuffle = YBAZSC 

Output:YES
