Given a binary string s and two integers x and y. Arrange the given string in such a way so that '0' comes X-times then '1' comes Y-times and so on until one of the '0' or '1' is finished. Then concatenate the rest of the string and find the final string.

Example 1:

Input:
X = 1, Y = 1, S = "0011"

Output: "0101"

Explanation: we put 1 '0' and 1 '1' alternatively.

Example 2:

Input:
X = 1, Y = 1, S = "1011011"

Output: "0101111"

Explanation: We put '0' and '1' 
alternatively and in last we have to
put all '1' as there is no '0' left.

Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function arrangeString() which takes the string S and X, Y as inputs, and returns modified string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^3

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
