Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s. If there are multiple answers, return the one that appears first in the given string s.

Note: Substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, i.e. s[ i . . . . j ] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(s).

Examples :

Input: s = "forgeeksskeegfor"

Output: geeksskeeg

Explanation: There are several possible palindromic substrings like "kssk", "ss", "eeksskee" etc. But the substring "geeksskeeg" is the longest among all.


Input: s = "abacac"

Output: aba

Explanation: The palindromic substrings "aba", "aca" and "cac" all have the same length. Since "aba" appears first, it is the answer.


Input: s = "geeks"

Output: ee

Explanation: The longest palindromic substring present in the given string is "ee".


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3
