1. Sum of element of array given using recursion

2. Check is array is sorted or not using recursion

3. Reverse the element of array using array

4. Delete aplhabet 'x' from given string. Here we can give other alphabet to remove from given string.

5. Replace 'x' with 'abc'. Here we can generalise with other string also.

6. Delete consecutive duplicate. E.g: input: aabccd   output: abcd

7. Sort array in ascending order.

8. Take vector as int and sort it in ascending order. Use comparator function. Take vector of int pair.
   
   Enter number of element in array: 5
   
          4 2
         
          4 1
         
          5 2
         
          4 8
         
          5 1
         
         -----
      
          4 1
         
          4 2
         
          4 8
         
          5 1
         
          5 2

10. Sort vector of array in specific order mentioned below
    
    Enter number of element in array: 5
    
          4 2
          
          5 1
          
          4 1
          
          5 2
          
          4 8
      
          -----
         
          4 8
          
          4 2
          
          4 1
          
          5 2
          
          5 1

11. Lower bound function on array.

    lower_bound() of an element => if that element is present then lower bound is that element itself otherwise next higher element.

12. Lower bound on array form with vector.

13. Lower bound on set and also using direct inbuild function that is available in library of c++.

14. Using inbuild min element and maximum element function on array

15. Reverse operation on string
