You are given a 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m. Each row in the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to merge all the rows and return a single sorted array that contains all the elements of the matrix.

Examples :

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 3, 5, 7],
                [2, 4, 6, 8], 
                [0, 9, 10, 11]]
                
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

Explanation: Merging all elements from the 3 sorted arrays and sorting them results in: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4], 
                [2, 2, 3, 4],
                [5, 5, 6, 6],
                [7, 8, 9, 9]]
                
Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9] 

Explanation: Merging all elements from the 4 sorted arrays and sorting them results in:[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]

Constraints:

1 ≤ n * m ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 10^6
