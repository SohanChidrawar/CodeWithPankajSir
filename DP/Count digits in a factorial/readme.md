Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function facDigits() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns the number of digits in factorial of N.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
