Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function noOfDigits() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, number of digits in Nth Fibonacci number
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^3
